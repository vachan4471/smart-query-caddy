Tuesday: 10,253\n3. Wednesday: 7,854\n\n- Morning walks averaged 4,200 steps\n- Evening walks averaged 5,100 steps\n\n| Day | Steps | Calories |\n|-----|-------|----------|\n| Mon | 8,420 | 320 |\n| Tue | 10,253 | 410 |\n| Wed | 7,854 | 290 |\n\nFor more information, visit [Our Fitness Portal](https://example.com/fitness).\n\n![Step Count Chart](https://example.com/step-chart.jpg)\n\n> Walking 10,000 steps daily significantly improves cardiovascular health.";
